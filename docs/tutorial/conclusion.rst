Conclusion
==========

This tutorial currently only covers a small (but important) part of Dulwich.
It still needs to be extended to cover packs, tags, refs, reflogs and network
communication.

Dulwich is abstracting much of the Git plumbing, so there would be more to
see.

For now, that's all folks!
