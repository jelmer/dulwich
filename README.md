[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jelmer/dulwich.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jelmer/dulwich)

This is the Dulwich project.

It aims to provide an interface to git repos (both local and remote) that
doesn't call out to git directly but instead uses pure Python.

**Main website**: [www.dulwich.io](https://www.dulwich.io/)

**License**: Apache License, version 2 or GNU General Public License, version 2 or later.

The project is named after the part of London that Mr. and Mrs. Git live in
in the particular Monty Python sketch.

Installation
------------

By default, Dulwich' setup.py will attempt to build and install the optional C
extensions. The reason for this is that they significantly improve the performance
since some low-level operations that are executed often are much slower in CPython.

If you don't want to install the C bindings, specify the --pure argument to setup.py::

    $ python setup.py --pure install

or if you are installing from pip::

    $ pip install dulwich --global-option="--pure"

Further documentation
---------------------

The dulwich documentation can be found in doc/ and
[on the web](https://www.dulwich.io/docs/).

The API reference can be generated using pydoctor, by running "make pydoctor",
or [on the web](https://www.dulwich.io/apidocs).
