Description: 
              Python implementation of the Git file formats and protocols,
              without the need to have git installed.
        
              All functionality is available in pure Python. Optional
              C extensions can be built for improved performance.
        
              The project is named after the part of London that Mr. and Mrs. Git live in
              in the particular Monty Python sketch.
