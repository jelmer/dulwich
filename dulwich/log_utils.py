"""Logging utilities for Dulwich.

Any module that uses logging needs to do compile-time initialization to set up
the logging environment. Since Dulwich is also used as a library, clients may
not want to see any logging output. In that case, we need to use a special
handler to suppress spurious warnings like "No handlers could be found for
logger dulwich.foo".

For details on the _NullHandler approach, see:
http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#configuring-logging-for-a-library

For many modules, the only function from the logging module they need is
getLogger; this module exports that function for convenience. If a calling
module needs something else, it can import the standard logging module directly.
